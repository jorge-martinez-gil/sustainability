# ðŸŒ± Sustainability of Machine Learning Models

This repository provides an implementation of a **genetic programming algorithm** to optimize a **multi-objective function**, ensuring the sustainability of machine learning (ML) models. The rationale behind balancing **accuracy, interpretability, and energy efficiency** is to serve as example promoting responsible AI development.

## ðŸš€ Overview
Genetic Programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by **biological evolution**. It searches for mathematical expressions that optimize predefined objectives. This project applies GP to **evolve ML models** with a focus on three key aspects:

1. **Prediction Accuracy** â€“ Measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a test dataset.
2. **Model Simplicity** â€“ Encouraging interpretable solutions.
3. **Energy Efficiency** â€“ Minimizing computational power consumption.

This approach offers a **practical reference** for sustainable computing and can be adapted to various AI applications.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy deap scikit-learn
```

## ðŸ”§ Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jorge-martinez-gil/sustainability.git
   cd sustainability
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python sustainability.py
   ```

The script will:
- Load a sample dataset.
- Split it into training and testing sets.
- Execute the genetic programming algorithm.
- Output the **best evolved models** with their respective performance scores (MSE, simplicity, and energy efficiency).

This implementation provides a **foundation for further improvements**, such as refining the interpretability metric or improving energy consumption calculations.
